audio_recorder.UserData.pack  = []; %allocate for data package
audio_recorder.UserData.pwr_spect = []; %allocate for PSD

%attach callback function
time_value = 1; % how often the function should be called in seconds
set(audio_recorder,'TimerPeriod',time_value,'TimerFcn',@audioTimerFcn); % attach a function that should be called every second, the function that is called is specified below.

end

% CALLBACK FUNCTION
% This function will be called every [time_value] seconds, where time_value
% is specified above. Note that, as stated in the project MEMO, all the
% fields: pwr_spect, eyed, const and pack need to be assigned if you want
% to get outputs in the GUI.

% So, let's see an example of where we have a pulse train as in Computer
% exercise 2 and let the GUI plot it. Note that we will just create 432
% random bits and hence, the GUI will not be able to decode the message but
% only to display the figures.
% Parameters in the example:
% f_s = 22050 [samples / second]
% R_s = 350 [symbols / second]
% fsfd = f_s/R_s [samples / symbol]
% a = 432 bits
% M = 4 (using QPSK as in computer exercise)

% NOW THAT WE HAVE DECODED OUR MESSAGE; IT IS TIME TO SAVE THE DATA FOR THE GUI
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

recObj.UserData.const = rx_vec;

% Step 3: provide the matched filter output for the eye diagram
recObj.UserData.eyed.r = MF_output;
recObj.UserData.eyed.fsfd = fsfd;

% Step 4: Compute the PSD and save it. Note that it has to be computed on
% the BASE BAND signal BEFORE matched filtering
[pxx, f] = pwelch(received_signal,1024,768,1024, fs); % note that pwr_spect.f will be normalized frequencies
f = fftshift(f); %shift to be centered around fs
f(1:length(f)/2) = f(1:length(f)/2) - fs; % center to be around zero
p = fftshift(10*log10(pxx/max(pxx))); % shift, normalize and convert PSD to dB
recObj.UserData.pwr_spect.f = f;
recObj.UserData.pwr_spect.p = p;

% In order to make the GUI look at the data, we need to set the
% receive_complete flag equal to 1:
recObj.UserData.receive_complete = 1;
